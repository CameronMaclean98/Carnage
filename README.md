# Carnage
Carnage project from CSUSB CSE 441 Game Programming

This is an Real Time Strategy game made on the Unity engine and it's experimental Entity Component System

For this game, we split up into different groups, with myself taking the role of Lead Gameplay Programmer, and was in charge of a group of 12 other students. Most of this project was done in ECS at the time that a majority of ECS didn't work, and ultimately the audio and some of the animations were unable to be completed.
